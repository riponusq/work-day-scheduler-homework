# work-day-scheduler-homework
This is the homework of work-day-scheduler using third party api . I tried to make it as good as I can.

I have made this homework in the following ways:
At first I used Moment Js for the date and day.
I created timeblocks(business hours) in html.
I put the free awesome icon for submit button.
when i click the save button then the text on that time will be saved in the local storage.
when i restart the page the local storage text should be showed in the page.
